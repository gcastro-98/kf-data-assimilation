 doi={10.18637/jss.v027.i03},
 abstract={Automatic forecasts of large numbers of univariate time series are often needed in business and other contexts. We describe two automatic forecasting algorithms that have been implemented in the forecast package for R. The first is based on innovations state space models that underly exponential smoothing methods. The second is a step-wise algorithm for forecasting with ARIMA models. The algorithms are applicable to both seasonal and non-seasonal data, and are compared and illustrated using four real time series. We also briefly describe some of the other functionality available in the forecast package.},

 abstract={We describe an &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;R&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; package focused on Bayesian analysis of dynamic linear models. The main features of the package are its flexibility to deal with a variety of constant or time-varying, univariate or multivariate models, and the numerically stable singular value decomposition-based algorithms used for filtering and smoothing. In addition to the examples of &amp;quot;out-of-the-box&amp;quot; use, we illustrate how the package can be used in advanced applications to implement a Gibbs sampler for a user-specified model.},
